Caltech CS2 Assignment 9: Othello

See [assignment9_part1.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/caltechcs2/othello/blob/master/assignment9_part1.html) and [assignment9_part2.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/caltechcs2/othello/blob/master/assignment9_part2.html)

I contributed by writing the code for the player. I wrote the initialization
function and the function that actually makes moves.

I made the AI tournament-worthy by writing a heuristic based on the location of
the game board. I made the corners worth the most and the spots near the 
corners worth the list and chose the available move that optimized the game 
board placement.
